While not the same they are both light collections of data

Tuples - Orders collection of elements 
        - Faster than list and immutable


Sets - Could be interpreted as formal mathematical sets?
        - Do not have duplicate values
        - There is no order
        - You can't access item in a set by index

Sets and Tuples can be created with {} and ()
 - also with the set() or tuple()
