Session
Now let’s set up to use session!

In our terminal, head to the directory where manage.py resides and run the following commands:

  # Need to be in same directory as manage.py file
  > python manage.py makemigrations
  > python manage.py migrate
Excellent. Not only does that annoying warning you’ve been suffering disappear, 
but now session is now available to us (as seen in that last line: Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK).

Now we can restart our server and use session:

request.session # It's a dictionary, so you can attach key/value pairs
As request.session is just a dictionary, you can attach any key/value pairs.  
For example, in the views.py file, you could do:

request.session['name'] = request.POST['name']
request.session['counter'] = 100
In the html file, Django lets you directly access request.session.  
For example to access request.session['name'], simply do:

{{request.session.name}}
Useful session methods:
request.session['key']

This will retrieve (get) the value stored in key
request.session['key'] = 'value'
Set the value that will be stored by key
del request.session['key']

Deletes a session key if it exists, throws a keyError if it doesn’t. Use along with try and except since it’s better to ask for forgiveness than permission
'key' in request.session

Returns a boolean of whether a key is in session or not
{{ request.session.name }}
Use dot notation (.) to access request.session keys from templates since square brackets ([]) aren’t allowed there
